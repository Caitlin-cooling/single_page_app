# Single Page App
The goal of this project is to practise using APIs in the simplest possible form.

### The Brief
Create a simple sinatra app that:
- has one page with a button.
- You can click the button and data from https://async-workshops-api.herokuapp.com/people shows up on the page without refreshing.
